DualLensDemo Notes:

- Copy the dependencies for the APIs used in this example to the libs folder
    if accessing the DimensionPlusUtility class, you will also need to add to the libs folder:
    armeabi-v7a/libDimensionPlusLib.so (or copy all)
    if accessing DimensionPlusView, you will also need 
    libMatrix and armeabi-v7a/libHMSGallery_libMatrix.jar
    
- This sample requires an HTC One (M8) to run
