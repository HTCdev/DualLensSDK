DimensionPlusDemo Notes:

- See the dependencies for the APIs used in this example under the libs folder
    if accessing the DimensionPlusUtility class, you will also need to at least add to the libs folder:
    armeabi-v7a/libDimensionPlusLib.so from the DependencyLibs folder (or add all)
    
- this sample does not require an HTC One M8 device to run unless using libDimensionPlusLib or DualLens dependencies
